# Wagmi + RainbowKit + Web3.js Integration

This repository demonstrates the integration of RainbowKit for wallet connection and Wagmi for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts using React hooks. It has two branches:

1. **main**: Uses RainbowKit and Wagmi hooks for both reading from and writing to contracts.
2. **rainbow-wagmi-web3.js**: Uses RainbowKit for wallet connection and Web3.js for contract interactions, utilizing Wagmi client as a provider.

## Branches

### main

The `main` branch uses RainbowKit to connect to wallets such as MetaMask and Trust Wallet and leverages Wagmi React hooks for interacting with smart contracts. 

- **Deployed Link**: [rain-wagmi.netlify.app](https://rain-wagmi.netlify.app/)

#### Features

- Connect wallets using RainbowKit.
- Read from and write to Ethereum smart contracts using Wagmi hooks.
- Easy integration with various Ethereum-based wallets.

### rainbow-wagmi-web3.js

The `rainbow-wagmi-web3.js` branch uses RainbowKit to connect to wallets and Web3.js for contract interactions. It uses the Wagmi client as a provider, enabling a streamlined approach to both reading and writing to contracts.

- **Deployed Link**: [rainbow-wagmi-web3js.netlify.app](https://rainbow-wagmi-web3js.netlify.app/)

#### Features

- Connect wallets using RainbowKit.
- Use Web3.js for reading from and writing to Ethereum smart contracts.
- Leverage Wagmi client for enhanced provider management.
